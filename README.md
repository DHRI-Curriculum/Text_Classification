# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

In this workshop, you will learn fundamental machine learning concepts, including how to build features for a classification task, how to build a text classification system that can predict whether sentences belong to one category ("news") or another ("romance"), and how to prepare data for machine learning using Pandas, a package for Python that helps to organize your data. We will also learn how to use the scikit-learn package for Python and how to evaluate the results of the analysis.
