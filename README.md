# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Learning objectives
In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:
- How to use skills from the NLTK workshop to build features for a classification task
- How to build a text classification system that can predict whether sentences belong to one category ("news") or another ("romance")
- How to model the topics in a corpus based on the distributions of words across the documents
- How to group data and perform calculations on the aggregations
- How to prepare data for machine learning using *pandas*, a package for Python that helps to organize your data
- How to use the scikit-learn package for Python to perform different types of machine learning on the data
- How to evaluate the results of machine learning algorithms
- How to visualize observations, aggregations, and algorithmic results


This workshop will review key concepts for understanding how machine learning works, and walk participants through the process of analyzing data using statistical and machine learning methods.
