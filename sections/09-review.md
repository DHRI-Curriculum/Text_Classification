- How to group data and perform calculations on the aggregations
- How to prepare data for machine learning using `pandas`, a package for Python that helps to organize your data
- How to use the `sklearn` ("scikit-learn") package for Python to perform different types of machine learning on the data
- How to evaluate the results of machine learning algorithms
- How to visualize observations, aggregations, and algorithmic results
