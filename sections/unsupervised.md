# How does unsupervised machine learning work?

In supervised machine learning tasks, the data is assigned to some set of classes. For example, here we are given a dataset wherein each observation is a set of physical attributes of an object. In an supervised task, the object column acts as the labels. The algorithm then uses these existing seperations in the data to develop criteria for classifying unknown observations in the data. 

label | Height | Width | Color  | Mass | Round ?
-----  | -------| ------| -------| ---- | -------
Apple  | 6cm    | 7cm   | Red    | 330g | TRUE   
Orange | 6cm    | 7cm   | Orange | 330g | TRUE   
Lemon  | 5cm    | 4cm   | Yellow | 150g | FALSE  

In contrast, in an unsupervised machine learning task there either are no labels or that information is just treated as another attribute of the observation. In our fruit example, the object type is now just another characteristic of the observation, and often is altogether unknown:

object | Height | Width | Color  | Mass | Round ?
-----  | -------| ------| -------| ---- | -------
Apple  | 6cm    | 7cm   | Red    | 330g | TRUE   
Orange | 6cm    | 7cm   | Orange | 330g | TRUE   
Lemon  | 5cm    | 4cm   | Yellow | 150g | FALSE  
 
An unsupervised algorithm is not told how the data is structured or seperated (barring parameter tuning), instead the algorithm goes looking for stucture and seperation in the data. Clustering algorithms seek groupings in the data, and dimension reduction techniques aim to decrese the number of rows and columns in a dataset by finding which features best optimize some goal. Generally speaking, in an unsupervized task there is no existing labeling to compare the results of the algorithm to; instead we often evaluate reliability through repeated experiments, computing the odds of our data being generated by our model, and visualizations.
