# Introduction

In this workshop, we are going to learn how to go through the process of doing *machine learning* on a set of data.   To do so, we will download a *corpus* of text data to work with, extract *features* from this data, and do *supervised* machine learning to our data, using a mathmatical algorithm to train a*classifier* which will then classify previously unseen data into a set of predefined categories.



> "Machine learning is a research field that sits at the intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer science. It is also known as *predictive analytics* or *statistical learning*."

## Key terms

- *machine learning*: An application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed
- *corpus*: A large collection of data.  In our case, this will be text data (although a corpus can contain any type of data)
- *features*: Properties that describe data entities for machine learning
- *feature representation, feature vector*: A set of features
- *supervised machine learning*:  A machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs
- *unsupervised machine learning*: A machine learning task used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses (lacks input-output pairs; only has input data)
- *algorithm*: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations (or other problem-solving operations), particularly by a computer
- *classification*: An machine learning task used to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities
